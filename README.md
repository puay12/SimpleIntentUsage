# Simple Intent Usages
It is a simple project implementing both Intent types, **Explicit Intent** and **Implicit Intent**. The main activity can also **get results** from the second activity. Saved instance state has also been implemented.\\
There are 6 cases/experiments for different Intent usages which a button represents each, there are:
* Move to the second activity
* Move with a certain data to the second activity
* Move with object to the second activity (using data class and Parcelable)
* Dial a number from the app using the default Android Phone app (Implicit Intent)
* Move for the result (getting the result from the second activity)
* Move to a detail page which implements ViewGroup, Styles, and Themes (light and dark)
